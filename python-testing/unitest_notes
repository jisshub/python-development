unittest
unittest has been built into the Python standard library since version 2.1. You will probably see it in commercial Python applications and open-source projects.

unittest contains both a testing framework and a test runner. unittest has some important requirements for writing and executing tests.

unittest requires that:

You put your tests into classes as methods
You use a series of special assertion methods in the unittest.TestCase class instead of the built-in assert statement.
