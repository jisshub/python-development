everything in python is an object.

objects have thier own methods and attributes.

using oop, we can structure, extend our code, also reuse it.

for that v break down the functionalities into different objects.

for exmple while creating an application, developers work on different functionalities and later combine them to form full fledged application.

class - blueprint/model of what v want to create.

and using this v acn create instances 

and this instances are called object.

can create any number of objct using the blueprint

oop allows to write code that is repeatable, memory efficient.


inheritance
-------------
classes in python can be extended.
creating new classes which get characteristics of the base class.

involes a superclass and subclass.

realtionship b/w superclass and sublclass defines a isa relationship
eg: rectangle is a polygon.

note: cant inherit the private members of supeclass into the subclass.
to get the provate members, v needto use getter and setter method in superclass.


multiple inheritance
-------------------
ability of a class to inherit rom multiple classes.

[
{"name": "jiss", "age":44},
{"name": "jiss", "age":44},
{"name": "jiss", "age":44},
]



({
"tactics": "long ball games",
"formation": "4-4-4",
"requirements":["a", "b", "c"]
})
